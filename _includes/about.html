Qlibs++ - Modern C++ libraries

  Mission

    Quality
      - C++20+ (gcc, clang, msvc*)
      - Compile-time self testing (can be disabled with -DNTEST)
      - Compiles cleanly with `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -fsantize=memory/undefined | /WX /W4`
      - Focused on declarative interfaces (easy to use hard to misuse) and composability

    Performance
      - Compile-time driven optimizations
      - x86-64* driven optimizations and benchmarks
      - No virtual, No RTTI, No exceptions
      - Focused on fast compilation times

    Simplicity
      - Single header (including documentation and tests)
      - Single purpose (unix philosophy)
      - Minimal dependencies (none or STL*)
      - Minimal API (available on https://compiler-explorer.com)

    > Yes, free forever.

  - Can Qlibs libraries be used in comercial projects?
    > Yes, license permits comerical usage - see License for details.

  - Is the aim for Qlibs libraries to be standarized?
    > The main goal for the libraries is to solve specific problem in the best
      possible way. Standarization, in some cases, may or may not follow but it's not a goal.

  - Are Qlibs libraries ABI stable?
    > ABI stability is not the main priority for the libraries - see Mission.

    > Github issues are prefered way for reporting issues.

  - How to contribute?
    > Contriubutions are always welcome -
        see https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests for details.

      Note: `main` branch should always be stable.

    > Github projects - https://github.com/orgs/qlibs/projects - can be used to
      request/add new libraries.

      Note: Mission goals are required to be fulfiled for new libraries.

  - How Qlibs differ from Boost/Poco/... libraries?
    > Both: Boost and Poco libraries are established and powerful C++ libraries.
      Qlibs libraries have different focus and goals - see Mission.
